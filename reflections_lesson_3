Reflections lesson 3:

git remote add nameOfRemote(origin) URL(gitHub URL) -> To create remote called origin;
git push nameOfRemote nameOfBranch -> To send local commits;

Reflection:

- When i use use fork, clone or branches?

*fork - I use fork when i want to get someone else`s content and stay connected
with original project;

*clone - I use clone when i just want clone someone else`s content;

*branch - I use a new branch when i want create a new changes on my projects without
change my original project;
